# Creative ISE design
## Course overview
In my Creative ISE course, our project focuses on identifying solutions for challenges within the Inha University campus. Throughout the course, we're honing our skills in real-life problem-solving by exploring various issues that students might encounter. Our objective is to understand the inconveniences they face and devise effective solutions.
